# Procurement-Insight-Dashboard

# Overview:
This project addresses the need for an insightful and data-driven dashboard to support the Procurement Department's strategic decision-making process. The Accounts Department maintains detailed vendor invoice data, while the Business Planner supplements this information with supplier and part-level details obtained from the Purchase Department. The goal is to analyze this data and uncover procurement trends, supplier constraints, opportunities for product-based supplier consolidation, and cost-saving strategies.

# Problem Statement:
The project faces several challenges due to the diverse nature of the data. Data spans multiple years and covers various plants and business units. Parts are manufactured from different materials (Aluminium or Ferrous) with varying raw material grades, and suppliers can be categorized as Tier 1 or Tier 2. These complexities necessitate the development of a comprehensive dashboard that provides valuable insights into all these factors, empowering the Procurement Department to optimize supply chain strategies effectively.

# Steps:
1.) Data Import:

Import all required data files into Power BI:
Supplier data.
Report files for 2019 and 2020.
Material weights and source data.

2.) Data Preparation:

Ensure data accuracy and consistency.
Correct data types as per the provided dataset description.
Resolve any errors or discrepancies.

3.) Load Data: 

Click on "Close & Apply" in Power BI to load the cleaned data.

# Visuals
1.) Non-MSME suppliers are basically the ones which have a Turnover > 100cr (1000 Million), Lower than this will be classified into different types of MSME category. How many of these suppliers do we have where we can not grow more business?

2.) We have a forecast that the business for ferrous casting will reduce year on year, show me how many of our ferrous casting suppliers we would need to stop business in future as the demand starts coming down.

3.) Find out the list of Small MSME suppliers where the supply chain will not increase till tier 2 suppliers as they will have full Casting and Machining capabilities.

4.) As per Government rules, we can't increase the payment terms more than 45 days for any type of MSME suppliers. Keeping this in mind do we have any Non-MSME suppliers where we can go above 45 days. If yes, what is the supplier name?

5.) Pune is one of the Flood Risk Zone, to prepare our supplier for difficult scenarios a taskforce has been assigned. Taskforce wants to know how many of our suppliers are from Pune?

6.) As Danny is handling a maximum of “Ferrous” suppliers, he wants to know which Part family in ferrous has the highest purchase volume?

7.) The Management wants us to minimize the risk with our suppliers, show me the biggest NoGo Suppliers that we have to target first?

8.) Kevin is planning to reduce the ferrous raw material prices for further years for his supplier, so far in the past 2 years which is the highest Tonnage consuming RM Grade and how many tons?

9.) Paul wants to increase the business with his 2nd biggest supplier. Out of the Part Families supplied by his 2nd biggest supplier, which part family has more than one supplier, also where less purchase volume comes from his second biggest supplier?

10.) We want to declutter the supply chain for our top 5 suppliers, we can decide to buy from one single source and negotiate for cost saving. check if they have more than one casting supplier?
